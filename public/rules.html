                <h2>How To Play</h2>
                <p>Pick 6 is a season-long competition where users compete against their group trying to accumulate as many points as possible.
                </p>
                <p>Points are accumulated by picking a team's spread or moneyline for that given week.</p>
                   <p>Can make up to 6 selections each week with an optional 7th pick.
                </p>
                <p>Certain picks have different point values.
                </p>

                    <li> <span class = "blue-highlight">Push</span>: <span class="yellow-highlight">+0.5 pts</span></li>
                    <li><span class = "blue-highlight">Favorited moneyline win</span>: <span class="green-highlight">+1 pt</span> (points change to <span class="yellow-highlight">+0.5 pts</span> if ML is -250 or higher)</li>

                    <li>-   No penalty for normal pick misses</li>
                    <li>-   Points are awarded directly after each batch of matchups</li>

                <h2>Immortal Lock</h2>
                <p>An optional 7th pick per week that can either gain users <span class="green-highlight">+1 pt</span> with a win or <span class="red-highlight">-2 pts</span> with a loss</p>
                <p>A spread or moneyline of any value will not alter the amount of points that can be gained or lost</p>
                <p>Ex: -400 ML earns the same amount of points as a +400 ML and no matter the line, a loss will always subtract 2 points</p>
                <p>A user must toggle on the “Set Immortal Lock” button in order to select an immortal lock for that week </p>
                <p>The toggle button can be found in the “Pick Selection Page” and the immortal lock will show up as the users 7th pick</p>

                <p>Meaning that users can not select the Bengals spread 2 weeks in a row</p>
                   <p> If a user selects the Bengals spread in week 5, that selection will be unavailable until week 7. However, Bengals Moneyline will be available for selection in week 6 and vice versa</p>

                <p>Picks open each week at 12am on Tuesday and close at 7pm on Thursday and can be made on the “Pick Selection Page”</p>
                <p>At 7pm on Thursday the “Pick Selection Page” will lock, selections will not be allowed and can not be altered. At that time all user selections for that week will be visible to the rest of the group</p>

               <p>If users want to create a private pool they can select on the public button to change it and a password will appear. Keep in mind these passwords are case sensitive!</p>
               <p> This feature also allows users switch between which modes they want to use upon pool creation: Classic or Survivor. </p>
               <p>The last option on the page (for classic mode only), is to enable playoffs. This will add a h2h bracket above the pool in week 14 and assign the top 10 users seeds based on their current ranking at the end of week 13. It will effectively end the regular season for users outside the top 10 but they will still be able to view the action unfold til the very end at Week 17. [This feature only supports pools of 6 or more users]</p>
